# Individually Addressable LEDs

Example code using the onboard DSP, FreeRTOS, and DMA to control individually addressable LEDs (SK6812).  This project has both non-audio patterns and audio syncing patterns.

## Architecture

The idea is to use 2 different tasks to manage the LEDs. The tasks are listed below by priority (higher numbers will preempt lower numbers).  I realize they could probably all be combined into one task, but more tasks means more learning.

0.  Idle Task
    -  Does nothing
1.  Pattern Task
    - Decides what pattern to show
    - Calculates RGB color based on selected pattern
    - 10ms (100 Hz)
2.  Refresh Task
    - Refreshes the actual colors shown on the LED strip
        - Initiates PWM pulse train
    - 10ms (100 Hz)

## Peripherals

#### Timers

```
Timer 2: 44.1 kHz timer for sampling audio voltage data 
Timer 4: LED Data Line
Timer 12: Collects runtime statistics (task time, computation times, ...)
```

#### GPIO:

```
C4: Audio voltage data in
B6: LED Data out
D12: LED4 (GRN) - Indicates stack overflow for vCreatePattern
D13: LED3 (ORG) - Indicates stack overflow for vUpdateLedStrip
D14: LED5 (RED)
D15: LED6 (BLU)
```

#### DMA:

```
DMA1 Stream 0: Transfer duty cycles to PWM module.
DMA2 Stream 0: Transfer ADC1->DR to buffers (used in double buffer mode).
```

#### ADCs:

```
ADC1 Channel 14: Samples audio voltage
```

## Notes
Use `xTaskCreateStatic` to create a task with the stack in a static location

Use `xTaskCreate` to create a task with the stack in a dynamic location

Use `vTaskDelayUntil` to schedule task to be run again

Use `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark` to see the highest of stack usage

Use `taskENTER_CRITICAL` to disable interrupts and tasks

Use `taskEXIT_CRITICAL` to re-enable interrupts and tasks

Use `portTICK_PERIOD_MS` to determine period of one clock tick/cycle
